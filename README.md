### 💻 Web Developer • Designer • Builder

Welcome to my GitHub profile!
Hello! I'm Pruthviraj Mundargi, a computer science professional whose journey has come full circle, from student to engineer to educator.

Hello! I'm Pruthviraj Mundargi, a computer science professional turned educator.

I began my journey in India, earning a Diploma from Bapuji Polytechnic and a B.Tech from REVA University.

I later completed my Master’s in Computer Science at Drexel University, USA.

Professionally, I've built healthcare platforms at Practo and cross-platform apps at ZineMind.

At ActiFi (USA), I worked on AI-powered assessment tools and full-stack applications.

I also interned at BLive as a UI/UX developer using Flutter, Dart, and Go Router.

My technical stack spans Python, Java, C/C++, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, and more.

I enjoy blending engineering with design to create intuitive digital experiences.

Today, I serve as an Assistant Professor at JIT, Davangere, mentoring B.Tech students.

I'm passionate about software development, AI, and education—always open to connecting!
